What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge ties the histories of the two branches that are being merged together but it will also mean 
more commits whenever you add something to main. Then rebase makes a more linear project history 
where your branch gets added onto the original branch but when you make changes to the orignal 
branch it could be lost in the project history.
